[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SensehacK/capstone-team4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SensehacK/capstone-team4)

## Description

Smart mobile devices are one of the best gifts of technology! The most important characteristics of our era may be the transformation, transmission and dominion of information. We live in an information society where the leading role has been given to new technologies, especially those devoted to information. Undoubtedly, smart phones have made significant contribution in human life and progress. This advancement is to make life easy and to increase human comfort at home and at work. With a rapid increase in the health industry being challenging on human’s well-being this application grants an opportunity to its members to get instant access to important health plan information. It also minimizes the need to install multiple health app to track health information thus, providing the members to get all the information in one app at a glance. A cross platform application which works on both Android and iOS platform for the users to get all required notifications of their daily routine and workout therefore making it viable.

## Build

### iOS Build

Clone the code and use Xcode v10+ to build the codebase.
Currently we haven’t added any packages to the build yet, if we do add those, you may need to do a quick

> pod install

For installing all of the package dependency handled by CocoaPods or Swift Package manager.
Open _.xcworkspace_ after package dependency has been installed.
Change the project with specific bundle identifier and run it on the simulator.
Alternatively you can run it on your phone given you have Apple Developer account.

### App Sign

Open the Xcode project and in “General” Tab select the Apple developer account you have under the dropdown menu. If you don’t have one you can add it using “Xcode-> Preferences-> Accounts”

After that change the Bundle ID of the app, to your liking and make sure you have similar ID’s across Watch App, Extension and  iOS App.
Make sure you check the Xcode Build Issues section of this ReadMe.

Trust the Developer certificate on your iOS device in Settings app “General->Device Management” Accept the installed app from Xcode so that you can run signed iOS app on your device.

## User Experience

### First Launch

Within first launch we would display onboarding screen comprising of 3 pages which will welcome our user with different information about the app usage and what data we collect, what permissions we require in order to proper functioning of app.

### Default Launch

Will directly display the main summary page which will show case the health information in chronograph format for easy glance of your health well being.

### Settings

- Dark Mode
Our app would support changing appearance according to the end user preferences.

- Reset Settings
The app will default all of the settings, so the end user would have first launch experience.

- Telemetry
Options to turn off telemetry stuff related to the app usage.

- In App Statistics
Options of turning off first party app usage tracking as well.

- Build Info
Information displayed about the app build meta data.

- About
Information about App production members. Tools we used and assets we incorporated in the project.


## Develop

### iOS

Install Swift Linter for proper code suggestions and we would also incorporate Unit tests as a way to be more compliant with Test driven development, even though this project isn’t designed and developed around TDD principles.

## Workflow

Please go through the Pinned workflows in [Issues section](https://github.com/SensehacK/capstone-team4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%C2%AF%5C_%5B%E3%83%84%5D_%2F%C2%AF)

## Test

### iOS Test

We are incorporating Unit tests as our default workflow.
The tests could be found in test branch and tests folder.

## CI/CD

We are utilizing Travis CI for checking our test cases while there is a pull request or master branch code commits.
[Travis CI iOS Doc](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/objective-c/#objective-c-vs-swift)
We are also trying to incorporate Github Actions but there are some hiccups with setting up our Cocoapods and linking with our Xcode build commands. If you could help us the PR is this [Actions](https://github.com/SensehacK/capstone-team4/actions?query=workflow%3ASwift)
[PR](https://github.com/SensehacK/capstone-team4/pull/19)

## Build Issues

This section would discuss about building issues only for iOS project.
I'm keeping track of any specific build errors with Xcode on this cheat sheet repo.
[Dev CheatSheet](https://github.com/SensehacK/dev-cheatsheet/tree/master/iOS_documentation)

- Pods couldn't find
The file “Pods-.xcconfig” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file.
cd to HealthSense $PWD

> pod install

So that cocoapods will reinstall properly & open using .xcworkspace


- App version and Build number mismatch
Make sure all of the version numbers and build info are in sync with companion apps. So that archive or running Xcode post build  phase scripts run properly.
Some of the version would be included in Info.plist Key-value pair, so given the Xcode error just perform the search on Xcode left explorer window and open that particular key.
